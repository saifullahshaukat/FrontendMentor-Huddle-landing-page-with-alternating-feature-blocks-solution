## My process

1. **Planning**: Before starting, I made a plan for what the website should look like and what features it should have. This included deciding on the layout, content, and functionality.

2. **Design**: Once I had a plan, I created the visual design of the website. This involved choosing colors, fonts, and images that fit the theme of the website. I also created wireframes to outline the layout of each page.

3. **Development**: With the design in place, I began coding the website using HTML, CSS, and possibly JavaScript. This step involved turning the design into a functional website that users can interact with.

4. **Testing**: After coding the website, I tested it to make sure everything works correctly. This includes checking for bugs, ensuring that all links and buttons work, and making sure the website looks good on different devices and screen sizes.

5. **Launch**: Once the website passed testing, I launched it and made it available to the public. This involved uploading the website files to a web server and configuring the domain name.

6. **Maintenance**: After launching the website, I continue to maintain it by updating content, fixing any issues that arise, and making improvements based on user feedback.

That's the basic process I followed to create your website! Let me know if you have any questions or need further explanation.

### What I learned

**What I Learned: Responsive Web Design and Media Queries**

While developing the Huddle landing page, I gained valuable insights into responsive web design and the utilization of media queries to ensure optimal user experience across various devices and screen sizes. One of the challenging aspects of this project was creating fluid layouts that adapt seamlessly to different viewport dimensions.

A particularly challenging part of the code snippet was implementing responsive design for the banner section. This involved adjusting the positioning and sizing of elements such as text, images, and buttons to maintain visual appeal and functionality across a wide range of screen sizes. Utilizing media queries, I learned to target specific breakpoints and apply custom styles to accommodate smaller mobile screens as well as larger desktop displays.

Additionally, mastering the organization and structure of CSS rules became crucial for maintaining clarity and modularity within the stylesheet. This involved properly grouping related styles, using meaningful class names, and leveraging cascading and inheritance to streamline the styling process.

Overall, through this project, I honed my skills in responsive web design, media queries, and CSS organization, enabling me to create engaging and accessible web experiences across diverse devices and screen resolutions
